## Experiments in Science, Art and Writing

#### *Spring 2022*

As a descriptor for works of art, “experimental” is a fraught term that can indicate a range of possible meanings: an association with a particular avant-garde movement, a commitment to procedural composition, an idiosyncratic test, a beholder’s admiration or skepticism, or, more rarely, a relationship to scientific knowledge making. Regardless of its definition (or resistance to definition), though, “experimental” is a powerful term across domains. In this course, we will take the scientific inflection of experiment seriously in relation to art, asking ourselves what we mean (and what we *could* mean) when we talk about experiment as a form of artistic practice. Focusing on examples from twentieth and twenty-first-century art across media, we will study important ways in which practices and postures associated with experimental science have been appropriated, adapted, reimagined, and critiqued. As we explore a range of models for science-inflected art practices and consider the stakes of “acting like scientists” across contexts, we will pay particular attention to laboratory art, its limits, and its possible future horizons. Key topics include feminist science fiction, proto-Afrofuturism, conceptual writing, BioArt, and citizen science.
