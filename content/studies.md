Fitch's *Autecology of the Copperhead* (1960) and *A Kansas Snake Community* (1999) and drawing on practices both within and outside scientific knowledge making, *Another Autecology of the Copperhead* follows nocturnal pit viper routines in Durham, NC each summer while tracking a particular species relationship through a series of new technical and epistemological ecologies.
