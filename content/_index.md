      My research focuses on postwar and contemporary poetry and science with an
      emphasis on experimental practice across discourses. Currently, my
      interests traverse ecopoetics, laboratory science, feminist technoscience,
      histories of scientific instrumentation, and avant-garde art and writing
      associated with practices of research, particularly as they relate to the
      physical and biological sciences. These interests are directed toward
      examining how durational research collaborations can support exchanges
      between practices of art and science across scales and modalities. In my 
      writing studies and public humanities work, I aim to scaffold
      critical-collaborative models of collectivity and explore
      community-oriented research from within its practice.


      My first book project, *Enduring Experiments,* investigates intersecting
      epistemological trajectories across the poetry of Clark Coolidge and
      Bernadette Mayer while taking both poets seriously as poet-researchers
      whose science-inflected writing practices and complex ways of interacting
      with their own laboriously generated poetic milieus challenge the limits
      of existing models for describing postwar poetryâ€™s engagement with
      experimental science. Across the book, I bring the discourse on experiment
      in science studies into contact with poetics, showing how experimental
      poetry can be a surprising source for alternative conceptual models of
      scientific subjectivity. Overlapping my work on this book, I co-edited the
      expansive Coolidge-Mayer correspondence, which extends across three
      decades. A key portion of the correspondence is forthcoming from
      University of New Mexico Press (Fall 2022). My next book project,
      tentatively titled *Sponge Poetics: Fuzzy Models for Everyday Science*,
      rethinks the concept of the model organism in the production of scientific
      knowledge in relation to a series of counter-possibilities in postwar and
      contemporary poetry and art. Repositioning the Anthropocene and
      environmental - draws out a model from science and poetry for X.
