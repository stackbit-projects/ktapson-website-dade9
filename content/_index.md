      My research focuses on postwar and contemporary poetry and science with an
      emphasis on experimental practice across discourses. Currently, my
      interests traverse ecopoetics, laboratory science, feminist technoscience,
      histories of scientific instrumentation, and avant-garde art and writing
      associated with practices of research, particularly as they relate to the
      physical sciences. These interests are directed toward examining how
      durational research collaborations support exchanges between practices of
      art and science across scales and environments. In my related writing
      studies and public humanities work, I aim to scaffold
      critical-collaborative models of collectivity and explore
      community-oriented research from within its practice.

      My first book project, *Enduring Experiments,* investigates intersecting
      epistemological trajectories across the poetry of Clark Coolidge and
      Bernadette Mayer, two poets whose impact on twentieth and
      twenty-first-century poetry continues to be generative and influential.
      Contesting the terms of their reception within the avant-gardes with which
      they are most often associated, I take both poets seriously as
      poet-researchers whose science-inflected writing practices and complex
      ways of interacting with their own laboriously generated poetic milieus
      challenge the limits of existing models for describing postwar poetryâ€™s
      engagement with experimental science. Throughout the book, I bring the
      discourse on experiment in science studies into contact with poetics,
      showing how experimental poetry can be a surprising source for alternative
      conceptual models of scientific subjectivity. Overlapping my work on this
      book, I co-edited the expansive Coolidge-Mayer correspondence, which
      extends across three decades. A key portion of the correspondence is
      forthcoming (Fall 2022) from University of New Mexico Press as *The
      Correspondence of Bernadette Mayer and Clark Coolidge, 1979-82.*


      My next book project, tentatively titled *Poetic Chemistry for Everyday
      Shapes*, follows a series of creature relationships that involve
      anthropocentric intervention in various ways: ants, beetles, flies,
      snakes. through webs of science and art, folding the book onto its body -

      of the Anthropocene is the way it projects the accumulation of human
      activity into the environment. Performing modes of environmental synthesis
