      My research focuses on postwar and contemporary poetry and science with an
      emphasis on experimental practice across discourses. Currently, my
      interests traverse ecopoetics, laboratory science, feminist technoscience,
      histories of scientific instrumentation, and avant-garde art and writing
      associated with practices of research, particularly as they relate to the
      physical and biological sciences. These interests are directed toward
      examining how durational collaborations can support exchanges between
      practices of art and science across scales and modalities. In my related
      writing studies and public humanities work, I aim to scaffold
      critical-collaborative models of collectivity and explore
      community-oriented research from within its practice.


      My first book project, *Enduring Experiments,* investigates intersecting
      epistemological trajectories across the poetry of Clark Coolidge and
      Bernadette Mayer, taking both poets seriously as researchers whose complex
      ways of interacting with their own laboriously generated poetic milieus
      challenge the limits of existing models for describing postwar poetryâ€™s
      engagement with experimental science. Throughout the book, I bring the
      discourse on experiment in science studies into contact with poetics,
      showing how experimental poetry can be a surprising source for alternative
      concepts of scientific subjectivity. Overlapping my work on *Enduring
      Experiments*, I co-edited the expansive Coolidge-Mayer correspondence,
      which extends across three decades. A key portion of the correspondence is
      forthcoming from University of New Mexico Press (Fall 2022). My next book
      project, tentatively titled *Sponge Poetics for Everyday Science*,
      rethinks \__ forms of experience through the lens of the model organism in
      laboratory science. - how to study a system with a model organism - what
      is the groundwork of that? experimental methods of scientific knowing
      through a series of counter-possibilities in postwar and contemporary
      poetry and art. mobilize these concepts Framing the model as a human ,
      humans, and nonhuman the moral and political urgency of the Anthropocene
      and environmental, I propose the organismal model as a site for inquiries
      at a moment when technology-driven transformations of these systems of
      experiment stand to complicate their potential to interface with artistic
      modes of inquiry. --> laboratories have shifted into the natural world -
      modes of artistic practice and description that ...
